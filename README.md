# DNSecure

DNSecure makes encrypted DNS available to your entire system.

This app uses the new [DNS Settings API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension/dns_settings), so it requires iOS 14, iPadOS 14, or later.

## How to use

1. Select a DNS server you like, or add another one
1. Enable "Use This Server"
1. Open the Settings
1. Go to "General" > "VPN & Network" > "DNS"
1. "Automatic" is selected by default, so select "DNSecure"
